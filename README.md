# Anomaly Detection
This repository includes the laboratory work I did during the **Anomaly Detection** course, which I took in my first year of an *MSc in Artificial Intelligence* at the *Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest*. 

#### Table of contents
- *L1*: introduction, blobs generation, ROC-AUC curves, and other metrics
- *L2*: leverage score, k-nearest Neighbours (kNN), local outlier factor (LOF)
- *L3*: isolation forest-based methods (IF, EIF, DIF), lightweight on-line detector of anomalies (LODA)
- *L4*: one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM)
- *L5*: dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis (PCA), autoencoders (AE)
- *L6*: graphs based anomalies detection
